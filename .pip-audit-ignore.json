      "reason": "Minerva timing attack on P-256 ECDSA signing operations (CVSS 7.4). NO FIX PLANNED - maintainers consider side-channel attacks out of scope. RISK ASSESSMENT: LOW for our use case. Rationale: (1) Transitive dependency via sendgrid (we don't directly use ecdsa), (2) We use HMAC-SHA256 for JWT signing (not ECDSA), (3) SendGrid likely uses ecdsa for signature verification (unaffected by timing attack), (4) Timing attack requires local/adjacent attacker, (5) No user-controlled ECDSA operations. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: Accepted as long as (a) we don't implement ECDSA signing, (b) sendgrid doesn't expose signing operations. REVISIT IF: We add webhook signature verification, hardware wallet support, or any feature using ECDSA signing. See PIP_AUDIT_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md for full analysis.",
