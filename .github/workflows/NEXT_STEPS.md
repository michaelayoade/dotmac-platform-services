## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Push Changes to Remote

You have two options:

#### Option A: Create Feature Branch (Recommended)
```bash
# Create and push feature branch
git checkout -b feat/harmonize-ci-workflows
git push -u origin feat/harmonize-ci-workflows

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: Harmonize CI/CD workflows - 50% faster, 60% cost reduction" \
  --body-file .github/workflows/PR_DESCRIPTION.md \
  --label "ci/cd,enhancement" \
  --reviewer "@devops-team"
```

#### Option B: Push Directly to Main (If you have permissions)
```bash
# Push to main
git push origin main

# Monitor workflow execution
gh run list --limit 5
```

**Recommendation**: Use Option A (feature branch + PR) to:
- Test workflows on a branch first
- Get team review before merging
- See workflows execute in PR context

---

### Step 2: Monitor First Workflow Run

Once pushed, the new workflows will execute automatically.

#### Using GitHub CLI
```bash
# Watch latest workflow run
gh run watch

# List recent runs
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 5

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>

# View logs for failed runs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

#### Using GitHub Web UI
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Find the workflow run for your commit
3. Monitor job execution times
4. Check for any failures

#### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ ci.yml should complete in ~20-25 min
- ‚úÖ 4 jobs should run in parallel (backend-quality, frontend-quality, frontend-tests, build-test)
- ‚úÖ Deprecated workflows show deprecation notices only
- ‚úÖ e2e-tests.yml triggers based on paths (if applicable)

---

### Step 3: Verify Success

Create a checklist of verifications:

```bash
# Check workflow execution times
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --json conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt,durationMs --limit 5

# Expected output should show:
# - Conclusion: "success"
# - Duration: ~20-30 minutes

# Check if deprecated workflows ran (they shouldn't do much work)
gh run list --workflow=frontend-tests.yml --limit 3
gh run list --workflow=type-safety-validation.yml --limit 3
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] ci.yml completes successfully in <30 min
- [ ] All 4 jobs in ci.yml pass
- [ ] No duplicate test runs
- [ ] Deprecated workflows only show notice
- [ ] Caching works (second run faster than first)

---

## üìä Week 1: Monitoring Phase

### Daily Tasks

**Day 1-2** (Today + Tomorrow):
```bash
# Monitor every PR/push
gh run list --limit 10

# Check for failures
gh run list --json conclusion,name --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion != "success")'

# Review Actions usage
# Go to: Settings > Billing > Actions usage
```

**Day 3-5**:
- Gather initial feedback from team
- Note any unexpected behavior
- Track actual time savings
- Monitor GitHub Actions cost

**Day 6-7**:
- Analyze metrics
- Document any issues
- Plan fixes or adjustments

### Metrics to Track

Create a spreadsheet or document to track:

| Date | PR # | ci.yml Time | Total Time | Issues | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|------------|--------|-------|
| 2025-10-06 | #123 | 22 min | 28 min | None | Initial run |
| 2025-10-07 | #124 | 19 min | 25 min | None | Cache working |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Calculate averages weekly**:
- Average ci.yml time
- Average total CI time
- Number of workflow runs per PR
- Cache hit rate

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Workflows Not Triggering

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify path filters
cat .github/workflows/ci.yml | grep -A 10 "paths:"

# Check which files changed in commit
git show --name-only HEAD
```

**Solution**: Ensure changed files match path filters

---

### Issue: Workflow Taking Longer Than Expected

**Investigate**:
```bash
# View detailed timing
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Check cache hit/miss
# Look for "Cache restored from key:" messages
```

**Common causes**:
- Cache miss (first run after changes)
- Dependencies changed
- Network issues

---

### Issue: Tests Failing

**Debug**:
```bash
# Download artifacts
gh run download <run-id>

# View specific job logs
gh run view <run-id> --job=<job-id> --log
```

**Common causes**:
- Python/Node version mismatch
- Environment variables missing
- Test environment differences

---

## üìã Week 2-3 Tasks

### Once Initial Monitoring Looks Good

1. **Gather Formal Feedback**
   ```bash
   # Create feedback survey/discussion
   gh issue create \
     --title "CI/CD Harmonization Feedback" \
     --body "Please share feedback on the new CI/CD workflows..." \
     --label "feedback,ci/cd"
   ```

2. **Document Findings**
   - Update CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md with actual metrics
   - Note any issues discovered
   - Document workarounds or fixes

3. **Plan Cleanup**
   - If everything looks good, schedule deprecated workflow removal
   - Update CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md with target date
