# Team Migration Kickoff - Quick Start

**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Team**: 4 developers (including you)
**Goal**: Complete 10+ remaining files in 1-2 days
**Current Progress**: 5/15 files complete (33%)

---

## 🚀 Your 30-Second Start

1. **Read**: `PARALLEL_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (15 min)
2. **Review**: Look at `tests/contacts/test_contact_creation.py` (5 min)
3. **Test**: Run `pytest tests/contacts/test_contact_creation.py -v` (1 min)
4. **Claim**: Pick a file from your assigned track (1 min)
5. **Migrate**: Follow the step-by-step process (1-2 hours per file)

## 📋 File Assignments

### Track 1: Contact Module (Developer 1)
**Priority**: HIGH | **Complexity**: LOW-MEDIUM | **Est**: 3-4 hours total

```bash
tests/contacts/test_contact_labels.py       # ~6 tests, similar to fields
tests/contacts/test_contact_activities.py    # ~5-7 tests, CRUD pattern
tests/contacts/test_contact_retrieval.py     # ~4-5 tests, get operations
```

**Why you**: These files use patterns we've already proven (create, list, get)

---

### Track 2: Billing Payments (Developer 2)
**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Complexity**: MEDIUM | **Est**: 4-5 hours total

```bash
tests/billing/payments/test_payment_creation_service.py    # ~8 tests, create pattern
tests/billing/payments/test_payment_service_core.py        # ~10-12 tests, mixed CRUD
```

**Why you**: Highest duplicate pattern count, biggest ROI

---

### Track 3: Billing Invoices (Developer 3)
**Priority**: HIGH | **Complexity**: MEDIUM | **Est**: 4-5 hours total

```bash
tests/billing/invoicing/test_invoice_creation.py              # ~4 tests, create pattern
tests/billing/invoicing/test_invoice_service_comprehensive.py # ~10-12 tests, full CRUD
```

**Why you**: Core billing functionality, applies same patterns

---

### Track 4: Lead Dev (Coordination + Complex)
**Priority**: MIXED | **Complexity**: HIGH | **Est**: 4-6 hours total

```bash
tests/contacts/test_contact_search.py           # COMPLEX: Search/filter logic
[Review all PRs from other developers]
[Fix any blocker issues]
[Update tracking documents]
```

**Why me**: Complex logic, team coordination, quality gate

## ⚡ Quick Pattern Reference

### Pattern 1: Simple Create (50% of tests)
```python
async def test_create_success(self, tenant_id, user_id):
    mock_db = build_mock_db_session()
    service = MyService(mock_db)

    data = MyCreate(name="Test")
    result = await service.create_entity(data, tenant_id=tenant_id, created_by=user_id)

    assert result is not None
    mock_db.add.assert_called_once()
    mock_db.commit.assert_called_once()
```

### Pattern 2: Update with Internal Call (20% of tests)
```python
async def test_update_success(self, tenant_id, sample_entity):
    mock_db = build_mock_db_session()
    service = MyService(mock_db)

    data = MyUpdate(name="Updated")

    # 🔑 KEY: Mock the internal get call
    with patch.object(service, "get_entity", return_value=sample_entity):
        result = await service.update_entity(id, data, tenant_id)

    assert result.name == "Updated"
    mock_db.commit.assert_called_once()
```

### Pattern 3: Delete Not Found (10% of tests)
```python
async def test_delete_not_found(self, tenant_id):
    mock_db = build_mock_db_session()
    service = MyService(mock_db)

    # 🔑 KEY: patch.object with None
    with patch.object(service, "get_entity", return_value=None):
        result = await service.delete_entity(uuid4(), tenant_id)

    assert result is False
    mock_db.delete.assert_not_called()
```

### Pattern 4: List Query (20% of tests)
```python
async def test_list_entities(self, tenant_id, sample_entity):
    mock_db = build_mock_db_session()
    service = MyService(mock_db)

    mock_result = Mock()
    mock_result.scalars.return_value.all.return_value = [sample_entity]
    mock_db.execute = AsyncMock(return_value=mock_result)

    results = await service.list_entities(tenant_id)
    assert len(results) == 1
```

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Mock at DB layer for internal calls | Tests fail | Use `patch.object(service, "method")` |
| Forget `allow_multiple_adds=True` | Tests fail | Check if entity has relationships |
| Check non-existent attributes | Tests fail | Check model definition first |
| Skip footer comment | Lost metrics | Copy template from examples |
| Don't backup file | Can't rollback | Always `cp file.py file.py.backup` |
