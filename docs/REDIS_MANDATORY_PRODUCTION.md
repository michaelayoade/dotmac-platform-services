# Redis Mandatory in Production

## Security Issue

**Severity**: MEDIUM → **HIGH** (after enforcement)
**Issue**: Session revocation was ineffective in multi-worker deployments without Redis
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Redis now mandatory in production

---

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue

The DotMac Platform Services application used an in-memory fallback for session management when Redis was unavailable. While this provided convenient development experience, it created a **critical security vulnerability in production**:

**Multi-Worker Session Isolation Problem**:
```
Worker 1: User logs in → Session stored in Worker 1's memory
Worker 2: Admin revokes session → Only Worker 2's memory cleared
Worker 1: User still has valid session! ❌

Result: Session revocation DOES NOT WORK across workers
```

### Security Impact

- **Session Hijacking Risk**: Compromised sessions cannot be reliably revoked
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR/SOC2 requirements for immediate access revocation not met
- **Privilege Escalation**: Demoted users retain elevated permissions until restart
- **Audit Trail Failures**: Session activities cannot be reliably tracked

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Settings Validation (`src/dotmac/platform/settings.py:182-216`)

Added Redis validation to production security checks:

```python
def validate_production_security(self) -> None:
    """Validate production security requirements."""
    if self.environment == Environment.PRODUCTION:
        # ... existing JWT and trusted hosts checks ...

        # SECURITY: Redis must be configured for multi-worker session management
        if not self.redis.host or self.redis.host == "localhost":
            raise ValueError(
                "SECURITY ERROR: Redis must be configured with production host in production. "
                "localhost is not suitable for multi-worker/multi-server deployments. "
                "Redis is MANDATORY for session revocation to work correctly across workers. "
                "Set REDIS__HOST to your production Redis server."
            )
```

**Effect**: Application **WILL NOT START** in production without proper Redis configuration.

#### 2. Health Check Enhancement (`src/dotmac/platform/monitoring/health_checks.py:123-181`)

Updated Redis health check with production-aware behavior:

```python
def check_redis(self) -> ServiceHealth:
    """Check Redis with production-aware fallback handling."""
    is_healthy, message = self._check_redis_url(settings.redis.redis_url, "Redis")
    is_production = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT").lower() in ("production", "prod")

    if not is_healthy:
        if is_production:
            # PRODUCTION: Redis failure is CRITICAL - blocks startup
            return ServiceHealth(
                name="redis",
                status=ServiceStatus.UNHEALTHY,
                message=(
                    f"{message}. "
                    "CRITICAL: Redis is MANDATORY in production for multi-worker session management. "
                    "Session revocation WILL NOT WORK without Redis. "
                    "Application startup BLOCKED."
                ),
                required=True,  # Blocks startup
            )
        else:
            # DEVELOPMENT: Allows fallback with warning
            return ServiceHealth(
                name="redis",
                status=ServiceStatus.DEGRADED,
                message=(
                    f"{message}. "
                    "WARNING: Running with in-memory fallback (DEVELOPMENT ONLY). "
                    "Session revocation does NOT work across multiple workers/servers. "
                    "DO NOT use in production."
                ),
                required=False,  # Allows dev startup
            )
```

**Effect**:
- **Production**: Redis unavailable = `UNHEALTHY` + `required=True` → **Startup fails**
- **Development**: Redis unavailable = `DEGRADED` + `required=False` → Starts with warning

#### 3. Application Startup (`src/dotmac/platform/main.py:50-108`)

Existing startup validation enforces the health checks:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Validate production security settings BEFORE anything else
    settings.validate_production_security()  # Raises ValueError if Redis not configured

    # Check service dependencies
    checker = HealthChecker()
    all_healthy, checks = checker.run_all_checks()

    # Fail fast in production if required services are missing
    if not all_healthy:
        failed_services = [c.name for c in checks if c.required and not c.is_healthy]
        if failed_services and settings.environment == "production":
            raise RuntimeError(f"Required services unavailable: {failed_services}")
```

**Effect**: Two layers of validation ensure Redis is available in production.

## Configuration

### Production Environment

**Required Environment Variables**:

```bash
# MANDATORY: Set environment to production
ENVIRONMENT=production

# MANDATORY: Configure production Redis server
REDIS__HOST=redis.production.example.com
REDIS__PORT=6379
REDIS__PASSWORD=<secure-password>

# Optional: Explicitly require Redis for sessions (default: true in production)
REQUIRE_REDIS_SESSIONS=true
```

### Development Environment

**Default Behavior** (Redis unavailable):

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development  # or omit (defaults to development)

# Redis not required - in-memory fallback used
# WARNING: Session revocation DOES NOT work across workers
```

**Recommended** (Redis available):

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development
REDIS__HOST=localhost
REDIS__PORT=6379
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying to Production

- [ ] **Configure Redis server** (managed service or self-hosted)
- [ ] **Set `REDIS__HOST`** to production Redis hostname
- [ ] **Set `REDIS__PASSWORD`** to secure password
- [ ] **Test connection** using health check endpoint
- [ ] **Verify startup** succeeds with Redis configured
- [ ] **Test session revocation** across multiple workers

### Health Check Endpoints

```bash
# Check if application is ready
curl http://api.example.com/health/ready

# Expected response when Redis is healthy:
{
  "status": "ready",
  "healthy": true,
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "redis",
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Redis connection successful",
      "required": true
    }
    // ... other services
  ]
}

# Expected response when Redis is unavailable in production:
{
  "status": "not ready",
  "healthy": false,
  "failed_services": ["redis"],
  "failed_required": ["redis"]
}
```

ENVIRONMENT=production \
SECRET_KEY=prod-key-12345 \
JWT__SECRET_KEY=jwt-secret-key-production-123456789012 \
TRUSTED_HOSTS='["api.example.com"]' \
REDIS__HOST=localhost \
python -m dotmac.platform.main

# Expected: ValueError raised, startup blocked

# 2. Test production startup SUCCEEDS with Redis
ENVIRONMENT=production \
SECRET_KEY=prod-key-12345 \
JWT__SECRET_KEY=jwt-secret-key-production-123456789012 \
TRUSTED_HOSTS='["api.example.com"]' \
REDIS__HOST=redis.production.example.com \
REDIS__PASSWORD=<password> \
python -m dotmac.platform.main

# Expected: Application starts successfully

# 3. Test development mode allows fallback
ENVIRONMENT=development \
python -m dotmac.platform.main

# Expected: Application starts with warning about in-memory fallback
```

## Monitoring

### Production Alerts

Set up alerts for:

1. **Redis Connection Failures**:
   ```
   Alert: Redis connection failed
   Condition: health check endpoint returns unhealthy status for redis
   Action: Page on-call engineer immediately
   ```

2. **Application Startup Failures**:
   ```
   Alert: Application failed to start
   Condition: Pod restarts > 3 in 5 minutes
   Action: Check Redis connectivity, review logs
   ```

3. **Session Revocation Latency**:
   ```
   Alert: Session revocation taking too long
   Condition: Session delete latency > 1 second
   Action: Check Redis performance, investigate load
   ```

### Logging

Application logs structured events:

```json
{
  "event": "service.dependency.check",
  "dependency": "redis",
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "healthy": false,
  "required": true,
  "message": "CRITICAL: Redis is MANDATORY in production...",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur After Deployment

**Option 1: Restore Redis Service** (Preferred)
```bash
# Check Redis status
kubectl get pods -l app=redis

# Restart Redis if needed
kubectl rollout restart deployment/redis

# Verify health
curl http://api.example.com/health/ready
```

**Option 2: Emergency Bypass** (UNSAFE - Use Only as Last Resort)
```bash
# Temporarily downgrade to development mode (NOT RECOMMENDED)
# This disables all production security validations
# Session revocation WILL NOT WORK
kubectl set env deployment/api ENVIRONMENT=development

# IMPORTANT: Fix Redis and redeploy with ENVIRONMENT=production ASAP
```

**Option 3: Rollback Deployment**
```bash
# Rollback to previous version without Redis requirement
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api

# Note: Previous version has session revocation vulnerability
# Plan to fix Redis and redeploy with fix ASAP
```

## FAQ

### Q: Why is Redis mandatory in production but not development?

**A**: Development typically runs a single worker process, so in-memory session storage works correctly. Production runs multiple workers/servers, requiring shared Redis storage for sessions to work across all workers.

### Q: Can I use a Redis cluster?

**A**: Yes! Configure `REDIS__HOST` to point to your Redis cluster endpoint. The application supports Redis Sentinel and Redis Cluster configurations.

### Q: What happens if Redis goes down during operation?

**A**:
- **Existing sessions**: Continue working until they expire naturally
- **New sessions**: Cannot be created (auth endpoints return 503)
- **Session revocation**: Does not work until Redis recovers
- **Health endpoint**: Returns `unhealthy` status

### Q: Can I use Memcached or another cache?

**A**: No. The session manager specifically requires Redis features (TTL, atomic operations, pub/sub for future features). Memcached and other caches don't provide the same guarantees.

### Q: How do I test session revocation works correctly?

**A**:
```bash
# 1. Create session on worker 1
curl -X POST http://worker1.example.com/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password"}'
# Returns: {"access_token": "...", "session_id": "sess_123"}

# 2. Revoke session on worker 2
curl -X DELETE http://worker2.example.com/auth/sessions/sess_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"
# Returns: 204 No Content

# 3. Try to use session on worker 1
curl http://worker1.example.com/api/protected \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sess_123"
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (session was revoked)
```

### Q: What about horizontal scaling?

**A**: Redis handles horizontal scaling perfectly. All workers/servers share the same Redis instance(s), so sessions work correctly regardless of which worker handles the request.
