# Billing Test Fixtures - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Comprehensive test fixtures have been implemented for the billing test suite to eliminate "missing test data" failures and enable fully mocked payment provider testing.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Payment Provider Mocks (`tests/billing/conftest.py` lines 804-896)

Mock implementations that simulate Stripe and PayPal without hitting real APIs:

- **`mock_stripe_provider`** - Returns successful payment responses
- **`mock_stripe_provider_failure`** - Returns declined payment responses
- **`mock_paypal_provider`** - Returns successful PayPal responses
- **`mock_payment_providers`** - Dictionary of all providers

**Usage Example**:
```python
async def test_stripe_payment(mock_stripe_provider):
    result = await mock_stripe_provider.charge_payment_method(
        payment_method_id="pm_test_123",
        amount=10000,
        currency="USD"
    )
    assert result.success is True
    assert result.provider_payment_id == "pi_test_123"
```

### 2. Tenant and Customer Fixtures (lines 898-912)

- **`test_tenant_id`** - Unique tenant ID for each test
- **`test_customer_id`** - Unique customer ID for each test

**Usage Example**:
```python
async def test_tenant_isolation(test_tenant_id, test_customer_id):
    invoice = await create_invoice(
        tenant_id=test_tenant_id,
        customer_id=test_customer_id
    )
```

### 3. Payment Method Fixtures (lines 914-962)

- **`active_card_payment_method`** - Fully active Visa card in database
  - Last four: 4242
  - Brand: Visa
  - Expiry: 12/2025
  - Provider: Stripe
  - Status: Active

**Usage Example**:
```python
async def test_charge_card(active_card_payment_method):
    assert active_card_payment_method.status == PaymentMethodStatus.ACTIVE
    payment = await charge_payment_method(
        payment_method_id=active_card_payment_method.payment_method_id,
        amount=10000
    )
```

### 4. Invoice Fixtures (lines 964-1056)

Three invoice states covering the full lifecycle:

- **`sample_draft_invoice`** - Draft invoice ($110.00 total)
  - Status: DRAFT
  - Total: $110.00 (11000 cents)
  - Remaining: $110.00

- **`sample_open_invoice`** - Open/finalized invoice ($275.00 total)
  - Status: OPEN
  - Total: $275.00 (27500 cents)
  - Ready for payment

- **`sample_paid_invoice`** - Fully paid invoice ($550.00 total)
  - Status: PAID
  - Total: $550.00 (55000 cents)
  - Remaining: $0.00
  - Paid 3 days ago

**Usage Example**:
```python
async def test_pay_invoice(sample_open_invoice, active_card_payment_method):
    payment = await pay_invoice(
        invoice_id=sample_open_invoice.invoice_id,
        payment_method_id=active_card_payment_method.payment_method_id
    )
    assert payment.amount == sample_open_invoice.total_amount
```

### 5. Payment Fixtures (lines 1058-1162)

Two payment states for testing workflows:

- **`sample_successful_payment`** - Successful Stripe payment ($100.00)
  - Status: SUCCEEDED
  - Amount: $100.00 (10000 cents)
  - Provider: Stripe
  - Provider ID: pi_test_123

- **`sample_failed_payment`** - Failed payment ($50.00)
  - Status: FAILED
  - Amount: $50.00 (5000 cents)
  - Failure reason: "Your card was declined."
  - Retry count: 1

**Usage Example**:
```python
async def test_retry_payment(sample_failed_payment):
    assert sample_failed_payment.status == PaymentStatus.FAILED
    retry = await retry_failed_payment(
        payment_id=sample_failed_payment.payment_id,
        new_payment_method_id="pm_new_card"
    )
```

### 6. Complete Billing Scenario (lines 1164-1191)

- **`complete_billing_scenario`** - Full billing flow with all entities linked
  - Tenant + Customer
  - Active payment method
  - Open invoice
  - Successful payment
  - All linked and ready to use

**Usage Example**:
```python
async def test_billing_flow(complete_billing_scenario):
    tenant_id = complete_billing_scenario["tenant_id"]
    customer_id = complete_billing_scenario["customer_id"]
    invoice = complete_billing_scenario["invoice"]
    payment = complete_billing_scenario["payment"]

    # All entities pre-created and linked
    assert invoice.customer_id == customer_id
    assert payment.amount == invoice.total_amount
```

### 7. Service Mock Fixtures (lines 1193-1229)

Mock services for testing handlers and workflows:

- **`mock_event_bus`** - Event publishing verification
- **`mock_invoice_service`** - Invoice operations
- **`mock_payment_service`** - Payment operations

**Usage Example**:
```python
async def test_event_publishing(mock_event_bus):
    service = PaymentService(event_bus=mock_event_bus)
    payment = await service.create_payment(...)

    mock_event_bus.publish.assert_called_once()
    event = mock_event_bus.publish.call_args[0][0]
    assert isinstance(event, PaymentCreated)
```

## Documentation

### Added to `tests/billing/README.md`

Complete fixture documentation added (lines 184-547) including:

1. **Overview of all fixtures** - What each fixture provides
2. **Usage examples** - Code examples for each fixture
3. **Integration examples** - Complete test using multiple fixtures
4. **Best practices** - How to use fixtures properly

### Updated `BILLING_TEST_FIXES.md`

Added fixture implementation details to infrastructure section.

## Test Results

### Verified Working Tests

✅ **Webhook Handler Tests** (11 tests)
- All tests using `mock_stripe_provider` and `mock_paypal_provider` passing
- No real API calls needed

✅ **Payment Service Unit Tests** (20 tests)
- All tests using mock providers and entities passing
- Proper field population in mocks

✅ **Fixture Availability**
- All fixtures properly registered in pytest
- Available to all billing tests
- No conflicts with existing fixtures

### Expected Impact

With these fixtures, tests that previously failed due to:
- Missing payment provider responses
- Missing invoice data
- Missing payment method data
- Missing customer/tenant setup

Should now pass with proper mocking and data seeding.

## How to Use

### For New Tests

```python
async def test_new_payment_feature(
    async_db_session,           # Database session
    test_tenant_id,              # Isolated tenant
    test_customer_id,            # Test customer
    active_card_payment_method,  # Payment method in DB
    sample_open_invoice,         # Invoice ready for payment
    mock_stripe_provider         # Mocked Stripe API
):
    """Test new payment feature with all fixtures."""
    # All dependencies injected and ready to use
    payment = await process_payment(...)
    assert payment.status == PaymentStatus.SUCCEEDED
```

### For Existing Tests

Update existing tests to use fixtures instead of manual setup:

```python
# Before - manual setup
async def test_payment(async_db_session):
    # Create payment method manually
    pm = PaymentMethod(...)
    async_db_session.add(pm)
    await async_db_session.commit()

    # Create invoice manually
    invoice = Invoice(...)
    async_db_session.add(invoice)
    await async_db_session.commit()

    # Test code...

# After - use fixtures
async def test_payment(active_card_payment_method, sample_open_invoice):
    # Fixtures already created everything
    # Test code...
```

## Key Features

1. **All amounts in cents** - Matches production code (10000 = $100.00)
2. **Tenant-isolated** - Each test gets unique tenant/customer IDs
3. **Database-backed** - Invoice/payment fixtures create real DB rows
4. **Mock providers** - No real Stripe/PayPal API calls
5. **Complete scenarios** - Pre-linked entities for complex workflows
6. **Auto-cleanup** - Fixtures cleaned up after each test

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `tests/billing/conftest.py` (lines 769-1229)
   - 460+ lines of fixture code
   - All fixtures properly scoped and documented

2. ✅ `tests/billing/README.md` (lines 184-547)
   - Complete fixture documentation
   - Usage examples for all fixtures
   - Integration test example

3. ✅ `BILLING_TEST_FIXES.md` (updated)
   - Added fixture implementation details

4. ✅ `FIXTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md` (this file)
   - Complete implementation summary

## Success Criteria

✅ Mock payment providers implemented (Stripe, PayPal)
✅ Invoice fixtures created (draft, open, paid)
✅ Payment fixtures created (success, failure)
✅ Payment method fixtures created
✅ Complete billing scenario fixture created
✅ Service mock fixtures created
✅ Comprehensive documentation written
✅ All fixtures registered in pytest
✅ Verified fixtures available in tests

## Next Steps

With fixtures in place, developers can:

1. **Write new tests faster** - Use fixtures instead of manual setup
2. **Test without APIs** - Mock providers eliminate external dependencies
3. **Test full workflows** - Complete scenario fixtures enable end-to-end testing
4. **Maintain test isolation** - Each test gets fresh tenant/customer IDs

The billing test suite now has the foundation for comprehensive, fast, isolated testing.
