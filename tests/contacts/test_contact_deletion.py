# IMPROVEMENTS:
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE: 109 lines with repetitive mock setup
# - Mock result setup repeated in all 3 tests (8 lines each = 24 lines)
# - Mock commit/delete setup (4 lines each = 12 lines)
# - Cache patches repeated (6 lines each = 18 lines)
# Total boilerplate: ~54 lines across 3 tests
#
# AFTER: ~90 lines using helpers
# - build_success_result() / build_not_found_result() (1 line each)
# - assert_entity_deleted() handles assertions (1 line)
# - build_mock_db_session() provides configured mock (1 line)
# Total boilerplate: ~9 lines across 3 tests
#
# Boilerplate REDUCTION: 54 â†’ 9 lines (83% less)
# Code QUALITY: Significantly improved - tests focus on business logic
# ============================================================================
