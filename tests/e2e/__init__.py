"""
End-to-End (E2E) tests for DotMac Platform Services.

E2E tests cover complete workflows through API endpoints,
testing the integration of routers, services, and data layers together.

These tests provide broad coverage with fewer test cases by exercising
full request-response cycles through the FastAPI application.
