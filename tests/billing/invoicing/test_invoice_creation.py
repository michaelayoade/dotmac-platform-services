# IMPROVEMENTS:
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE: 231 lines with repetitive mock setup
# - Mock result setup repeated in 5 tests (~6 lines each = 30 lines)
# - Mock refresh setup repeated in 4 tests (~10 lines each = 40 lines)
# - Mock commit/execute setup in all tests (~4 lines each = 20 lines)
# Total boilerplate: ~90 lines across 5 tests
#
# AFTER: 200 lines using helpers
# - build_mock_db_session() provides configured mock (1 line per test)
# - build_success_result()/build_not_found_result() simplify mocks
# - Cleaner mock refresh patterns (still needed for business logic)
# Total boilerplate: ~30 lines across 5 tests
#
# Boilerplate REDUCTION: 90 → 30 lines (67% less)
# ============================================================================
