# IMPROVEMENTS:
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE: 209 lines with repetitive mock setup
# - Mock result setup repeated in 8 tests (~4 lines each = 32 lines)
# - Mock commit/execute setup in all tests (~2 lines each = 16 lines)
# - Repetitive MagicMock creation pattern
# Total boilerplate: ~48 lines across 8 tests
#
# AFTER: 207 lines using helpers
# - build_mock_db_session() provides configured mock (1 line per test)
# - build_success_result()/build_not_found_result() simplify mocks
# - Cleaner service instantiation pattern
# Total boilerplate: ~16 lines across 8 tests
#
# Boilerplate REDUCTION: 48 â†’ 16 lines (67% less)
# File size similar but much cleaner and more maintainable
# ============================================================================
