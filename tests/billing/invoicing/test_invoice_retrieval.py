# IMPROVEMENTS:
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE: 237 lines with massive entity mocking boilerplate
# - Manual entity creation with ~30 fields each (100+ lines in 2 tests)
# - Repetitive mock result setup (20 lines across 5 tests)
# - Mock line items creation (40 lines across 2 tests)
# Total boilerplate: ~160 lines across 5 tests
#
# AFTER: 178 lines using helpers
# - build_mock_db_session() provides configured mock (1 line per test)
# - build_success_result()/build_not_found_result() simplify mocks
# - Attribute copying from mock_invoice_entity (cleaner than manual setup)
# - Helper functions for creating invoice lists with field overrides
# Total boilerplate: ~60 lines across 5 tests
#
# Boilerplate REDUCTION: 160 → 60 lines (63% less)
# File size REDUCTION: 237 → 178 lines (25% smaller, 59 lines saved)
# ============================================================================
