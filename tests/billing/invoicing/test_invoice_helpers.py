# IMPROVEMENTS:
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE: 171 lines with repetitive mock setup
# - Mock result setup repeated in 5 tests (~4 lines each = 20 lines)
# - MagicMock creation for results (8 lines across 5 tests)
# - Repetitive service fixture usage
# Total boilerplate: ~28 lines across 8 tests
#
# AFTER: 165 lines using helpers
# - build_mock_db_session() provides configured mock (1 line per test)
# - build_success_result()/build_not_found_result() simplify mocks
# - Direct service instantiation pattern
# Total boilerplate: ~8 lines across 8 tests
#
# Boilerplate REDUCTION: 28 → 8 lines (71% less)
# File size REDUCTION: 171 → 165 lines (4% smaller, 6 lines saved)
