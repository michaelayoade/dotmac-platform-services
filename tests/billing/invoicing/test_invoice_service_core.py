"""
Core Invoice Service Tests - Phase 1 Coverage Improvement

Tests critical invoice service workflows:
- Invoice creation (with line items)
- Invoice finalization
- Invoice voiding
- Payment tracking
- Credit application
- Overdue invoice detection
- Idempotency handling
- Webhook event publishing
- Tenant isolation

Target: Increase invoice service coverage from 9.97% to 70%+
