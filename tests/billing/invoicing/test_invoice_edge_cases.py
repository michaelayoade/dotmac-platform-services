# IMPROVEMENTS:
# ============================================================================
# BEFORE: 147 lines with repetitive mock setup
# - Mock result setup repeated in 3 tests (~4 lines each = 12 lines)
# - Repetitive mock refresh setup (10 lines in 1 test)
# - MagicMock creation patterns (12 lines across 3 tests)
# Total boilerplate: ~34 lines across 3 tests
#
# AFTER: 140 lines using helpers
# - build_mock_db_session() provides configured mock (1 line per test)
# - build_success_result()/build_not_found_result() simplify mocks
# - Preserved custom mock_refresh for zero amounts test
# Total boilerplate: ~12 lines across 3 tests
#
# Boilerplate REDUCTION: 34 → 12 lines (65% less)
# File size REDUCTION: 147 → 140 lines (5% smaller, 7 lines saved)
