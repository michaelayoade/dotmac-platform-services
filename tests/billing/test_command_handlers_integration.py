"""
Integration tests for billing command handlers with real database.

Tests handlers work correctly with actual database persistence.
Focuses on commands that don't require complex setup.

NOTE: These are simplified integration tests focusing on:
- Handler execution with real services
- Database transaction handling
- Basic validation and error handling
