## üö® Critical Updates - High Priority

### ‚è∞ Pending Security Updates

| Package | Current | Target | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| **pip** | 25.2 | **25.3** | üî¥ HIGH | ‚è≥ Waiting for release | **CVE-2025-8869**: Tarfile link escape vulnerability. Update IMMEDIATELY when 25.3 is released. See `.pip-audit-ignore.json` and `PIP_AUDIT_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md` |

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Check weekly for pip 25.3 release
poetry run pip index versions pip | head -20

# When 25.3 is available, update immediately:
poetry run pip install --upgrade pip
poetry run pip --version  # Verify 25.3+
poetry run pip-audit      # Should clear GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph

# Remove from .pip-audit-ignore.json after update
# Update PIP_AUDIT_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md to reflect fix
```

---

## üìã Regular Dependency Updates

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Check for pip 25.3 release (until available)
- [ ] Review GitHub security alerts
- [ ] Check Poetry lock file for outdated critical packages

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Run full `poetry update` for non-breaking updates
- [ ] Run `poetry run pip-audit` and review new vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review `.pip-audit-ignore.json` expiration dates
- [ ] Update Python dependencies with security patches

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Review ecdsa usage in codebase (ensure we still don't use ECDSA signing)
- [ ] Check if SendGrid has moved away from ecdsa
- [ ] Audit all cryptographic dependencies
- [ ] Review and update `PIP_AUDIT_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`

## üîÑ Update Process

### 1. Pre-Update Assessment
```bash
# Check current vulnerabilities
poetry run pip-audit --desc

# List outdated packages
poetry show --outdated

# Review changelogs for breaking changes
# Check GitHub releases for major version bumps
```

### 2. Apply Updates
```bash
# Update specific package (recommended)
poetry update <package-name>

# Or update all (with caution)
poetry update

# Verify lock file changes
git diff poetry.lock
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite
make test

# Run security checks
poetry run pip-audit
poetry run bandit -r src/ -ll
poetry run mypy src

# Test in staging environment
# Smoke test critical features
```

### 4. Post-Update Verification
```bash
# Verify no new vulnerabilities introduced
poetry run pip-audit

# Check for dependency conflicts
poetry check

# Update security assessment if needed
vim PIP_AUDIT_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Exception Management

### Current Accepted Vulnerabilities

Tracked in `.pip-audit-ignore.json`:

1. **pip 25.2** (GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph)
   - **Expires**: When pip 25.3 is released (or 2025-12-31 hard deadline)
   - **Next Review**: 2025-11-07
   - **Action**: Update to pip 25.3 immediately when available

2. **ecdsa 0.19.1** (GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp)
   - **Expires**: No expiration (maintainer won't fix)
   - **Next Review**: 2026-01-07 (quarterly)
   - **Action**: Monitor for SendGrid updates; review if we add ECDSA signing

### Exception Review Process

**When reviewing exceptions**:
1. Check if vulnerability still exists in current version
2. Verify mitigations are still in place
3. Re-assess risk level based on code changes
4. Update `.pip-audit-ignore.json` with new review date
5. Update `PIP_AUDIT_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md` if risk changes

**When to remove exceptions**:
- Package is updated to fixed version
- Package is removed from dependencies
- Risk is no longer acceptable (code changes, new attack vectors)
- Exception expiration date is reached
