### Branding Initializer

```bash
# Generate .env.branding with interactive prompts
pnpm branding:init
```

The script saves your answers in `.env.branding` (and can append to `.env.local`). Restart `pnpm dev` so Next.js picks up the updates.

## Customization

1. **Run `pnpm branding:init`** to scaffold env variables, then tweak `platformConfig.branding` / `platformConfig.theme` in `lib/config.ts` if you need token-level control.
2. **Theme Styles**: Adjust Tailwind utilities in `tailwind.config.ts` and baseline CSS variables in `app/globals.css`.
3. **Auth**: Choose provider variant in `ClientProviders.tsx` (Simple/Secure/Enterprise).
4. **API**: Update endpoints in `lib/config.ts`.
5. **Pages**: Add your routes in the `app/` directory.

## Production Deployment

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

### Vercel
```bash
vercel deploy
```

### Manual
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Known Issues

### Storybook Smoke Test

**Issue**: `pnpm storybook:smoke` fails with webpack compilation errors.

**Root Cause**: Known incompatibility between `@storybook/nextjs` 8.6.14 and Next.js 14.2.x webpack configuration. The error occurs during webpack's cache shutdown phase:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'tap')
```

**Workaround**:
- Webpack caching is disabled in `.storybook/main.ts` to mitigate the issue
- Storybook smoke test is **not** included in CI workflow
- Regular Storybook dev server (`pnpm storybook`) works for manual testing

**Resolution Timeline**:
- ✅ Short-term: Skipped in CI, documented here
- ⏳ Medium-term: Wait for Storybook 8.7+ or Next.js 15 with better compatibility
- 🔄 Alternative: Consider Storybook 7.6.x (stable with Next.js 14)

**Related**: [Storybook Issue #24708](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/24708)

## Next Steps

1. Set up your backend API at `localhost:8000`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
3. Customize branding and theme
4. Add your business logic and pages
5. Deploy to production
