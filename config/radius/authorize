# FreeRADIUS authorize file
#
# PRODUCTION: This file should be EMPTY or contain only non-authenticating
# entries. All authentication must go through the SQL database to enforce
# tenant isolation and RBAC.
#
# For local testing/healthcheck, mount a separate authorize.test file.
#

# DEFAULT - Fall through to SQL database for authentication
DEFAULT Auth-Type := SQL
        Fall-Through = Yes
